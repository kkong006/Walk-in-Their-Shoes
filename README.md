# Walk in Their Shoes

This Android Application was created in response to the Journey: Help Extends Beyond the Boarders challenge at the San Diego Women's Hackathon 2016.

Although the refugee crisis seems distant, human needs connect all people. the idea behind the Walk in Their Shoes app is a campaign that focuses on bringing families together around the globe, so that families with stability can connect to families in need.  Help extends beyond borders. The refugee crisis is not an issue that involves merely one nation of people; it is one that involves the world. The borders between people geographically is usually not the deepest issue, rather it is the borders that people create for others in their hearts. People are prone to stereotype or to harbor their possessions and personal space, closing them off to the ways in which they can help others. The refugee crisis today involving Syria is something the world knows about and that most Americans know about, but few are taking action. Real people are risking their lives to come to America and Europe. 

Walk in Their Shoes (or WITS) is similar to a dating site. It matches people or families in stable areas to refugee families. The app allows people to choose either the needs they can help with or for refugees, the needs they may have. From there, it creates a match between the two sides and allows them the opportunity to connect with a donor.
